## <font color = grey>Purpose
---
In this blog post, we will interact with the `flask` python package to create a simple webapp. Some of the learning points for this excises include: flask fundamentals, database management, and basic CSS modifications. Here is a link to the [repository holding files of this webapp](https://github.com/SamuelShi6/BlogPost2)(https://github.com/SamuelShi6/BlogPost2). 

## <font color = grey>Method
---
The app that we are going to build today is a simple message bank which mainly has two functions:
1. Allow the user to submit messages to the bank.
2. Allow the user to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.

Before everything, we need to import the necessary packages for today's activity. So we need the `flask` for our webapp and `sqlite3` for the interactions with the database. 

```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request
import sqlite3
import string
```
First we imported the `Flask` class. 
Next we create an instance of this class by writing the line:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
The first argument is the name of the application’s module or package. `__name__` is a convenient shortcut for this that is appropriate for most cases. This is needed so that Flask knows where to look for resources such as templates and static files. We then use the `route()` decorator to tell Flask what URL should trigger our function. For instance in this case, we are just going to the main page:
```python
@app.route("/")
def main():
    return render_template("main.html")
```
The function returns the message we want to display in the user’s browser. The default content type is HTML, so HTML in the string will be rendered by the browser.

In order to view the app on our local browser, run the following command line:
```
export FLASK_ENV=development; flask run
```

### Step 0. Base.html
Before starting on any particular templates, we can build one `basic.html` such that it is easier for users to navigate between different pages. Then the other templates can just use `extend` `basic.html` to inherit all the links.
```html
{% raw %}<!doctype html>
<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} - PIC16B Website</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
<nav>
  <h1>Blog Post 2: A Message Bank</h1>
  <!-- <b>Navigation:</b> -->
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('main') }}">Introduction</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('submit') }}">Submit Messages</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('view') }}">View Messages</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<section class="content">
  <header>
    {% block header %}{% endblock %}
  </header>
  {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</section>{% endraw %}
```

### Step 1. Enable Submissions and Construct a Database
In our first step, we will complete the part where users can input messages that are stored in our database. 
First, we will create the following template `submit.html` to allow the users to input their messages and handles (names). Notice that we use the `extend` `'base.html'` in the beginning so we can navigate to other pages conveniently. For the block content, if we want to receive input from the user, we first create a label for the user to input their `message` and `handle`. Then a submit button in the end. For the last two `if-statements`, we want to see if the user succesfully input the data, which will be explained later. 
```html
{% raw %}{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
  <h1>{% block title %}Submit{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <form method="post">
      <label for="message">Your Message: </label>
      <input name="message" id="message">
      <br>
      <label for="handle">Your Name or Handle: </label>
      <input name="handle" id="handle">
      <br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit Message">
  </form>
  {% if thanks %}
    <br>
    Thanks for submitting a file!
  {% endif %}
  {% if error %}
    <br>
    Oh no, we couldn't use that file! 
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```
After finishing writing the template, then we have to first write two functions for database managent:
- `get_message_db()` should take care of creating the database. First, it wants to check if the database `message_db` already exists in the `g` attribute of the app. If not, create such a database. Second, check if the table `messages` exists in the database, and run SQL command to create such a table if it does not exist. The table should contain three columns: `id` (an integer), `handle` (text) and `message` (text). In the end, the function will return the connection `g.message_db`.

```python
def get_message_db():
    # create a database if does not exist
    if 'message_db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")
   
    # cmd line to create the table
    cmd = \
    """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    handle TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL
    );
    """

    c = g.message_db.cursor()
    c.execute(cmd)

    # return the connection
    return g.message_db
```

- `insert_message(request)` helps us insert the user input into the database. Referring back to the template `submit.html` above, we label the message the user input as `message`, and the name/handle the user input as `handle`. Then we can easily access these information by calling the `request` object. Next, we will employ database management tools to create a connection with the database, provide an ID number (1 plus the total no. of rows), insert the entry, save the insertion, and eventually remember to close the connection.

```python
def insert_message(request):
    # retrieve user input
    message = request.form['message']
    handle = request.form['handle']

    # create a connection and cursor
    db = get_message_db()
    c = db.cursor()

    # generate ID
    current_row_number = (c.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages")).fetchone()[0]
    current_row_number += 1

    # insert entry into the database
    c.execute(f"INSERT INTO messages VALUES ({current_row_number},'{handle}','{message}')")

    # save the insertion
    db.commit()

    # close the connection
    db.close()
```

Finally, we just need to `render_template()` the `submit.html` template. We will include both POST and GET methods because we need the page to both transmit and receive data. For the GET case, we will just render the template with no other parameter; while for the POST case, we first call `insert_message()`, render the template, add a small note (referring back to the template) to thank for their submission, and konw that we have succesfully insert the entry to the databse; otherwise, the website will give an error message and we can adjust our code accordingly. 
```python
# tell what URL should trigger our function
@app.route('/submit/', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else:
        try: 
            # insert the entry
            insert_message(request)

            # output the thankyou note
            return render_template('submit.html', thanks = True)
        except:

            # output the error message
            return render_template('submit.html', error = True)
```
Here's what it looks like on the webpage:
![submit.png](/images/submit.png)

### Step 2. View Random Submissions
In displaying the messages that we have saved to the database `messages_db`, we will first write a function called `random_messages(n)` that will return a collection of n random messages from the message_db, or fewer if necessary. 
```python
def random_message(n):
    # get the connection and cursor
    db = get_message_db()
    c = db.cursor()

    # generate n random rows from the table
    c.execute(f"SELECT handle, message FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT {n}")
    results = c.fetchall()

    # close the connection
    db.close()
    return results
```
Then, we will write a new template `view.html` to display the messages extracted from the random.messages(). Here we can take advantage of the fact that Jinja tags support looping and Jinja tags support indexing of objects (so if m is a tuple of user handle and message m[0] contains the handle and m[1] contains the message).
```html
{% raw %}{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
  <h1>{% block title %}View{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <ul>
      {% for n in results %}
      <li>{{n[1]}}</li>
      <em>- {{n[0]}}</em>
      <br><br>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</body>
{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```
We are nearly at the end of the task. In the last part, we will create a function to render the `view.html` template. The function first grab n random messages from the database `messages_db`. For simplicity, we set `n=5` for this exercise; and then we pass the messages as an argument to `render_template()`. 
```python
# tell what URL should trigger our function
@app.route('/view/', methods = ['POST', 'GET'])
def view():
    # generate 5 random messages
    results = random_message(5)
    try:
        # pass the message to the template
        return render_template('view.html', results = results)
    except:
        return render_template('view.html')
```
Here's the screencap of a user viewing submitted messages, and we can see our message inserted earlier on is in the middle:
![view.png](/images/view.png)

### Step 3. Style
If we want to modify our webapp to make it more presentable, we can go to the `style.css` file to change the color, font, margins, etc. For instance, I have changed the header's font family to `serif` and the content's font family to `fantasy`. In addition, I adjust the color of background to dark blue because blue is my favorite color, and change the margins of the boxes to spread out the empty space.
